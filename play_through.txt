You are woken up by a loud crash. You, sit up, disoriented, then lie back down and try to go back to sleep. Some moments pass, then a steady rumbling noise starts up from somewhere above you.
You try telling yourself to just ignore it but the sound worries at the edges of your consciousness, sometimes receding until you start to hope that it has stopped, before roaring back to life again.
You get up, attempt to stretch your stiff limbs. Nothing is going to get done if you don't investigate and the noise is getting on your nerves.

The room is lit by a wall of fire stretching across the width of the chamber. You vaguely wonder how the fire is being fueled but are quickly distracted by the a tongue of flame that leaps a little too close to you. It is getting hot in here.

You open the papyrus scroll. The scroll consists of a series of spells to help assist the journery of a soul through the underworld into the afterlife.

That whole " getting through to the eternal afterlife " thing is only for royalty anyway.

You are in a large hall with pillars on either side of a walkway leading up to a large throne. The walls and pillars are carved with noble profiles staring regally down at you. They seem almost alive, as if at any minute a queen will step down and order you to go fetch her a snack.

You blink and details of the room emerge slowly from the mist, strange animals, statues and gold – everywhere the glint of gold. For the moment – an eternity it seems – you are struck dumb with amazement. You see wonderful things.

>inspect gold
The gold from numerous paintings glints in the light of your torch. They are not executed by the steadiest hand, but are hung carefully around the room. There are also cabinets painted in gold that house small trinkets like woven bracelets and letters.

You pole vault gracefully across the pit.

You see a strange group of people standing in the center of the dimly lit room, arguing. They seem foreign and very confused. Your natural ability with languages allows you to understand their conversation within a few minutes and you quietly approach them, putting your hand on the shoulder of the person nearest to you. It looks like they are in need of some assistance and you tell them so.
The man turns around, shrieks and clutches the arm of the woman standing next to him. She stares you down and asks if you are offering that assistance.
You were headed up anyway since that is where the noise seems to be coming from, and you are a generous person so you figure why not help them out? You manage to navigate them to the exit without any more mishap.They seem a bit battered and are extremely flustered but you get part of their story on the way. It turns out your initial assessment was correct. They had entered the pyramid in search of uncountable treasures but had gotten lost almost right away. Looks like they had been warned by the locals too. Classic tourists, but pretty harmless as these things go.
Once you arrive at your destination, you discover that the final room boasts a gaping hole where there had formerly been a nice solid wall. More to the point, this seems to be the source of the noise. One of the foreigners sheepishly mentions that they be a bit aggressive be able to fit everyone in through the entrance. You do not bother glancing outside because it is very bright outside and all that really matters is that you know how to fix your problem now. After sending the group off on their merry way, you go find some stones to wall off the hole.
Satisfied with your work, you head back down. You find the room you started in, and finally get to rest in peace.
There is a dark opening in the south wall.

What do you do next?
